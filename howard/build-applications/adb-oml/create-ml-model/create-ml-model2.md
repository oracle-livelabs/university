### Before You Begin

Remember that we are trying to help Alpha Office predict the credit and payment suitability of their customers. We can use machine learning to help us here because we already have a set of customers with known credit and payment status. This is what we are going to use to train a model that will predict for new customers if their credit is suitable.

This lab uses a decision tree algorithm which is a classification technique. If these are new to you, here’s a [presentation](https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/n/natdcshjumpstartprod/b/adbml/o/Machine_Learning_Introduction.pdf) and a short video below that explains machine learning, classification, and decision trees at a high level.

In this lab, you will use Apache Zeppelin notebooks to do this work. The lab will help you create a new notebook, and also import an existing one with all the code, descriptions, and examples that you need. You will then step through that notebook, examining the code, data, and visualizations and, most importantly, executing each step to populate the database.

### Objectives

- Import an Apache Zeppelin notebook.
- Become familiar with Oracle Machine Learning Algorithms.
- Create a machine learning model to determine factors that predict good credit.

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have completed the following labs:
- Login to Oracle Cloud/Sign Up for Free Tier Account
- Connect and Provision ADB

## Task 1: Create ML Notebook

1.  Click the **Navigation Menu** in the upper left, navigate to **Oracle Database**, and select **Autonomous Data Warehouse** and navigate to your instance.

    ![](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/common/images/console/database-adw.png " ")

    ![](./images/adw-instance.png " ")

    On the **Tools** tab of your ADW instance, and click on **Open Oracle ML User Administration**.

    ![](./images/tools.png " ")

    ![](./images/open-ml-admin.png " ")

    Sign in as **Username - ADMIN** with the password you used when you created your Autonomous instance.

    ![](./images/ml-login.png  " ")

2.  In the Machine Learning User Administration, click on the **home icon** on the upper right.

    ![](./images/home-icon.png  " ")

3.  Log in as **ML\_USER** and provide the password you created in lab 1 for the ML\_USER. Before you log in, you may wish to bookmark this page.

    ![](./images/mluser-sign-in.png  " ")

4.  Navigate around to get familiar with the ML pages. Click on **Examples**.

    ![](./images/examples.png  " ")

5.  Note the various ML notebook examples. Feel free to review some of these. We will be creating a new ML notebook in this lab. Click on the upper-left hamburger menu.

    ![](./images/notebooks-menu.png  " ")

6.  Click on the upper-left hamburger menu and select **Notebooks**.

    ![](./images/choose-notebooks.png  " ")

7.  We will create a notebook from the beginning, select **Create**.

    ![](./images/018.png  " ")

8.  Enter **adwc_notebook** as the name, then click **OK**.

    ![](./images/019.png  " ")

9. Now you can view the notebook created - **adwc_notebook**.

    ![](./images/new-notebook.png " ")

## Task 2: Add Content to Your ADW Notebook

It is simple to create content in Zeppelin Notebooks, and the following exercise will give you experience in doing so.

1.  Click on the hamburger menu and select **Notebooks** in the upper left.

    ![](./images/046.png  " ")

    ![](./images/047.png  " ")

2.  Select the **notebook** you just created.

    ![](./images/adwc-notebook.png  " ")

3.  Click on the **gear** icon in the upper right. We must set the interpreter binding if we're going to connect to the ADW database and run queries. Be sure to select at least one of the **services** (High, Medium, or Low (or all)).

    ![](./images/gear.png  " ")

    Zeppelin notebooks are composed of paragraphs that can contain formatted text, sql, and script (pl/sql). Notebooks can support a broad range of scripting languages (python, R, etc.), but we'll just be using these three. We create different paragraphs with different interpreters based on what we want to put in the paragraphs. The interpreter is set at the top of the paragraph:
    - %md - markdown language which is used for formatted text.
    - %sql - used to run sql statements.  Note you can only run one statement per paragraph, otherwise use a script.
    - %script - used to run multiple sql statements and pl/sql blocks.

4.  Paste the following into the first paragraph. Then click on the **arrow** to run the code (format the text in this case.). Note that it displays the formatted text, and adds a new paragraph. Notebooks save automatically. There is no need to click a save button.

    ### Targeting Likely Good Credit Customers using Oracle Machine Learning's (OML) Classification Models

    Heather has spent most of her time over the past couple of years extracting and preparing data for analysis.  The large volumes of data need extracting and processing mean she spends most of her time waiting for jobs to finish and very little of her time analyzing the data.  Demands from marketing are forcing a new approach whereby the data remains in the data warehouse and is processed there.  The alternative cloud solution is more complex, and has no direct out of the box processes to analyze the data in place.  She started taking a look at Oracle, and found the simple SQL commands in ADW are familiar, and execute extremely fast, leveraging all the performance features of the platform.  Further once she is done can can apply the learning models to incoming data on the fly, and allow end user analysts to immediately see mining results.  This drastically reduces the cycle of data preparation, analysis, and publishing.  It also means there is no change to analysis/reporting Data Visualization toolset that users are familiar with.

    ![](./images/051.png  " ")

5.  Sometimes we just want the result (formatted text in this case), and not the code. Click on the **show editor** icon to hide the code.

    ![](./images/052.png  " ")

    ![](./images/053.png  " ")

6.  In the next paragraph enter the following, overwrite the %md that has defaulted in. Then hit **execute**.

    ````
    <copy>
    %sql

    /* This shows the credit scoring data we will use historical data to predict the likelihood of a customer having good credit. */

    Select * from ml_user.credit_scoring_100k where rownum &lt; 100
    </copy>
    ````

    ![](./images/select-table-run.png  " ")

    ![](./images/select-mluser-table.png  " ")

7.  To add a title, click on the **gear** icon and select **Show title**.

    ![](./images/show-title.png  " ")

8.  Enter the following into the title.

    ````
    <copy>
    Review Credit Scoring Data
    </copy>
    ````

    ![](./images/edit-title.png  " ")
    ![](./images/057.png  " ")

9.  In this last example, enter the following in the next paragraph and then execute the script. Review Data by Mode of Job Contacts and Income.

    ````
    <copy>
    %sql

    /* This is a basic example of a chart visualization in Zeppelin.  This particular one is a column graph.  Click on the 'settings' link below.  That will show you the fields in the query that were used to create the chart.  After you review the settings you can click on the link again to hide the settings. */

    select customer_id, age, income, tenure, loan_type, loan_amount, occupation, number_of_current_accounts, max_cc_spent_amount, mode_job_of_contacts from ml_user.credit_scoring_100k where rownum &lt; 1000
    </copy>
    ````

    ![](./images/enter-paragraph.png  " ")

    ![](./images/select-query-output.png  " ")

10. Change the presentation style by selecting **bar chart** and then click on **Setting**.

    ![](./images/bar-chart.png  " ")

    ![](./images/settings.png  " ")

11. Drag and drop the fields into a position to review the results.

    ![](./images/drag-and-drop.png  " ")

12. Hide the settings by clicking on the **settings** label again.

    ![](./images/hide-settings.png  " ")

    So how does all this help us build ml models, collaborate with others, and review and share the results/findings?

    Zeppelin provides:
    - A collaborative shared workspace for model development.
    - A direct connection to all the data in your Autonomous Database that can scale to petabytes.
    - A platform for preparing data for model ingestion.
    - A visual pallet to display data and ml results.
    - A shared platform where discussion, documentation, execution, and results are presented together.

13. Finally, let's review some examples. Click on hamburger and navigate to the **Home** dashboard.

    ![](./images/hamburger-menu.png  " ")

    ![](./images/home.png  " ")

14. Navigate to **Examples**.

    ![](./images/click-examples.png  " ")

15. Select a model of interest. In this example, we will open **Anomaly Detection**.

    ![](./images/click-anamoly-detection.png  " ")

    ![](./images/anamoly-detection.png  " ")

## Task 3: Import ML Notebook

Adding content to a notebook is simple and fast. In this step, we have built the steps that are normally followed when exploring data and building a machine learning model. This has been saved to the file you can download. We will import this notebook and review it. It is important to note that you *must execute all the steps in this notebook if you wish to continue with lab 3 and 4*. Executing the steps takes only a few minutes.

1. Download the notebook [targeting\_customers\_that\_complete\_all\_payments\_v4.json](files/targeting_customers_that_complete_all_payments_v4.json?download=1).

2.  Navigate back to the Notebook page.

    ![](./images/020.png  " ")

3.  We will be importing a pre-built notebook, and using this for the remainder of the lab. Select **Import**.

    ![](./images/021.png  " ")

4.  Go to the directory where you downloaded the JSON file and import the **targeting\_customers\_that\_complete\_all\_payments\_v4.json** notebook.

    ![](./images/import.png  " ")

5.  Select the **Targeting Customers That Complete All Payments** notebook.

    ![](./images/step4.4-023.png  " ")

6.  Before you start working the **Targeting Customers That Complete All Payments** you need to set the interpreter binging. Click on the gear icon.

    ![](./images/step4.5-024.png  " ")

7.  Select the **orcl_high** interpreter, drag and drop it to reorder and then **Save**.

    ![](./images/gear2.png  " ")

8.  Click on the **arrow** icon to run all paragraphs in the notebook.

    ![](./images/step4.7-026.png  " ")

    ![](./images/click-ok.png  " ")

9.  Click on the **output** icon to show the output and to view the code and the formatted text, click on **show editor** icon. Ensure that all the paragraphs are in **Finished** state and then click on **output** icon.

    ![](./images/step4.8-027.png  " ")

    ![](./images/step4.9-029.png  " ")

    ![](./images/step4.9-030.png  " ")

    ![](./images/step4.9-031.png  " ")

## Task 4: About this Notebook

The rest of this lab will be done interactively in the notebook. This step discusses the result of each portion of the notebook.

1. This graph illustrates Good\_Credit customers who complete all their payments are hard to find.

    ![](./images/nb3.png  " ")

2. This section illustrates how we can graph our understanding of the data.

    ![](./images/nb4.png  " ")

    ![](./images/nb5.png  " ")

3. Run the Attribute Importance to identify key variables that most influence the target attribute.

    ![](./images/nb6.png  " ")

4. Now, split the data into Train and Test data sets. Drop, then Build and Evaluate the Classification Model.

    ![](./images/nb7.png  " ")

5. Drop, build and evaluate multiple OML models for comparison.

    ![](./images/nb8.png  " ")

6. Join model outputs e.g. cumulative gains chart to view and assess model quality.

    ![](./images/nb9.png  " ")

7. Now, apply the model to make predictions.

    ![](./images/nb10.png  " ")

8. Apply the model to a single record to make a prediction.

    ![](./images/nb11.png  " ")

9. Verify the table or view.
