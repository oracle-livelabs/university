# Provision and Setup #

## Introduction ##

This lab is all about getting your environment set up correctly. Here we will show you how to provision two different autonomous database instances, load data into object storage, and set up credentials and tools.

### About Oracle Machine Learning

Simplifying greatly, you can split machine learning into two parts: the process of building and training a model so it is ready to work; putting that model to work in production systems, applications, and processes. In general, training a machine learning model takes significant computing resources. You should not run that kind of work in an existing data warehouse or data mart, without clearing it ahead of time because it’s possible that model training could use too many resources and impact SLAs. You definitely don’t want to build and train a model in any kind of critical transactional system for the same reason.

For this Alpha Office scenario, we provision two different autonomous databases. The autonomous data warehouse is used to build and train your model. Think of it as a stand-in for your own data warehouse or data mart. Alternatively, given how easy it is to provision a data mart, think of this ADW as the best way for you to do machine learning without impacting anybody else in the organization. Setting up a dedicated data mart for machine learning maybe the right thing for you to do outside of this lab.

But it’s not just about training the model - you also have to deploy it, and there are some options. You could deploy a model into a data warehouse where it’s available for analytics. Or maybe you want to deploy it into a production transaction processing system so that you can score each new transaction. Either way, you are going to need to know how to export and import a model. So we show you that in this lab using two different databases.

What Alpha Office wants is to deploy this machine learning model in a production database that supports their Client Service application. When an existing customer comes into the branch, we can pull up their name and check their credit in real-time. The marketing department can also load batch data into this system and run a process to score a new set of customers in bulk. So, this setup of just two different services allows you to build, train, and deploy a machine learning model into an application so that customer-facing and marketing employees can work with it.

### Objectives
-   Learn how to provision an ADW instance
-   Learn how to provision an ATP instance
-   Learn how to connect to ADW

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have completed the following labs:
* Login to Oracle Cloud/Sign Up for Free Tier

*Note: You may see differences in account details (eg: Compartment Name is different in different places) as you work through the labs. This is because the workshop was developed using different accounts over time.*

In this section, you will be provisioning an ADWC database and an ATP database using the cloud console.

## Task 1: Create an ADW Instance

First, we are going to create an ADW Instance.

1.  Click the hamburger menu, search for **Autonomous Data Warehouse**, and click on it.

    ![](./images/create-adw.png  " ")


2.  Select **Create Autonomous Data Warehouse**.

    ![](./images/006.png  " ")

3.  Select **Compartment** by clicking on the drop-down list. (Note that yours will be different - do not select **ManagedCompartmentforPaaS**) and then enter **Display Name**, **Database Name**.

    ![](./images/007.png  " ")

4.  Under **Choose a workload type** and **Choose a deployment type**, select **Data Warehouse**, and **Shared Infrastructure** respectively.

    ![](./images/008.png  " ")

5.  Under **Configure the database**, leave **Choose database version** and **Storage (TB)** and **OCPU Count** as they are.

    ![](./images/009.png  " ")

6.  Add a password. Note the password down in a notepad, you will need it later in Lab 2.

    ![](./images/010.png  " ")

7.  Under **Choose a license type**, select **License Included**.

    ![](./images/011.png  " ")

8.  Click **Create Autonomous Database**. Once it finishes provisioning, you can click on the instance name to see details of it.

    ![](./images/012.png  " ")

    ![](./images/013.png  " ")

You now have created your first ADW instance. Now, we are going to work on very similar steps to create an ATP Database.

## Task 2: Create an ATP Instance

1.  Click the hamburger menu and select Autonomous Transaction processing.

    ![](./images/014.png  " ")

2.  Select **Create Autonomous Database**.

    ![](./images/015.png  " ")

3.  Select **Compartment**. If you are using a LiveLabs environment, be sure to select the compartment provided by the environment. (Note that yours will be different - do not select **ManagedCompartmentforPaaS**) and then enter **Display Name**, **Database Name**.

    ![](./images/016.png  " ")

4.  Under **Choose a workload type** and **Choose a deployment type**, select **Transaction Processing**, and **Shared Infrastructure** respectively.

    ![](./images/017.png  " ")

5.  Under **Configure the database**, leave **Choose database version** and **Storage (TB)** and **OCPU Count** to how they are.

    ![](./images/009.png  " ")

6.  Add a password. Note the password down in a notepad, you will need it later in Lab 2.

    ![](./images/010.png  " ")

7.  Under **Choose a license type**, select **Bring Your Own License (BYOL)**.

    ![](./images/011a.png  " ")

8.  Click **Create Autonomous Database**. Once it finishes provisioning, you can click on the instance name to see details of it.

    ![](./images/021.png  " ")

    ![](./images/022.png  " ")

You now have created your first ATP instance.

## Task 3: Download the Credentials Wallet

1.  Click the hamburger menu and navigate to the **ADW Instance** you created in Step 1.

    ![](./images/023.png  " ")

    ![](./images/024.png  " ")

2.  In the instance details page find your database and click **Service Console**.

    ![](./images/025.png  " ")

3.  Click on **Administration** and click **Download Client Credentials (Wallet)**.

    ![](./images/026.png  " ")

    ![](./images/step3.3-027.png  " ")

4.  Specify a password of your choice for the wallet. You will need this password when connecting to the database later. Click **Download** to download the wallet file to your client machine.

    ![](./images/028.png  " ")

5.  Unzip the downloaded wallet file, note the cwallet.sso file, you will need it later in this lab.

    ![](./images/029.png  " ")

## Task 4: Download Files to Use in Lab 2

1.  Click the link below to download the install file.

    [install.zip](https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/n/natdcshjumpstartprod/b/adbml/o/install.zip)

2.  Save the install.zip to a download directory and then unzip the file.

    ![](./images/060.png  " ")

## Task 5: Create a Bucket ADW and Upload Your Data

1.  Click the hamburger menu, scroll down, and select Object Storage.

    ![](./images/031.png  " ")

2.  Select **Create Bucket** and create a bucket called **adwc** in your compartment (not ManagedCompartmentForPaas).

    ![](./images/032.png  " ")

    ![](./images/step5.2-033.png  " ")

3.  Select the **adwc** bucket. Under Objects, select **Upload Objects** to upload file **credit\_scoring\_100k** in git directory **ADWC4Dev/workshops/adwc4dev/install**.

    ![](./images/034.png  " ")

    ![](./images/035.png  " ")

    ![](./images/036.png  " ")

    ![](./images/037.png  " ")

    ![](./images/038.png  " ")

4.  Copy the URL Path to a notepad, we will need it later in this lab.

    ![](./images/039.png  " ")

    ![](./images/040.png  " ")

5.  We will also upload the **cwallet.sso** file from the wallet zip file we downloaded from the ADW Instance earlier. The cwallet.sso file will be used later, in Lab 3, but we will upload it now.

    ![](./images/041.png  " ")

    ![](./images/042.png  " ")

    ![](./images/043.png  " ")

6.  To load data from the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure(OCI) Object Storage you will need an OCI user with the appropriate privileges to read data (or upload) data to the Object Store. The communication between the database and the object store relies on the Swift protocol and the OCI user Auth Token. Go to Profile menu, click **User Settings** to view user details.

    ![](./images/step5.6-044.png  " ")

7.  Remember the username as you will need it in the next step.

    ![](./images/step5.7-045.png  " ")

8.  On the left side of the page, under Resources, click **Auth Tokens**, and then **Generate Token**. Call it **adwc_token**. *Note: Be sure to copy it to notepad as you won't be able to see it again.*

    ![](./images/046.png  " ")

    ![](./images/047.png  " ")

    ![](./images/048.png  " ")

    ![](./images/049.png  " ")

## Task 6: Log in to SQL Developer Web

1.  Next, we will log into the SQL Developer Web. Start by navigating to the ADW Instance page and clicking on **Service Console**.

    ![](./images/023.png  " ")

    ![](./images/024.png  " ")

    ![](./images/025.png  " ")

2.  Click on **Development**.

  ![](./images/051.png  " ")

3.  Select **SQL Developer Web**.

    ![](./images/052.png  " ")

4.  Log in with **Username** - **admin**, and with the **password**, you created for the ADW Instance back in Step 1.

    ![](./images/053.png  " ")

## Task 7: Create a Database Credential for Your Users

1.  Once you log into SQL Developer Web from your *ADW Instance*, your screen should look like the following:

    ![](./images/054.png  " ")

2.  To access data in the Object Store you have to enable your database user to authenticate itself with the Object Store using your OCI object store account and Auth token. You do this by creating a private CREDENTIAL object for your user that stores this information encrypted in your Autonomous Data Warehouse. This information is only usable for your user schema.

3.  Upon signing in to your SQL Developer Web, copy and paste this to SQL Developer worksheet. Specify the credentials for your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage service:

    - Username: The username will be the OCI Username you noted in step 5 (which is not the same as your database username).
    - Password: The password will be the OCI Object Store Auth Token you generated in step 5.

    In this example, the credential object named OBJSTORECRED is created. You reference this credential name in the following steps.

    ````
    <copy>
    BEGIN
      DBMS_CLOUD.CREATE_CREDENTIAL(
        credential_name => 'adwc_token',
        username => '&lt your cloud username &gt',
        password => '&lt generated auth token &gt'
      );
    END;
    /
    </copy>
    ````

    ![](./images/055.png  " ")

    Now you are ready to load data from the Object Store.

## Task 8: Loading Data Using dbms\_cloud.copy\_data package

1.  First, create your table. Enter the following in the SQL Developer Web.

    ````
    <copy>
    create table admin.credit_scoring_100k
