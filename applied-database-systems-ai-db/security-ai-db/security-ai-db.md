# Database Security

This workshop is a hands-on lab dedicated to the features and functionality of Oracle AI Database security to prevent, detect and mitigate the most common cyberattacks performed on Oracle AI Databases - for more details on each of the featured products, please refer to the DB Security livelabs.

In this lab, we will use a ransomware attack to explore how attackers operate and what database features you should use to prevent, detect, and mitigate data exfiltration risks.

A typical ransomware attack includes theft and exfiltration of data. The theft usually happens before encrypting your system to make it inoperable, with the stolen data used by the ransomware gang to help influence you to pay the ransom.

Ransomware Attack message

In order to make this possible, we provide you with the necessary infrastructure components based on an OCI architecture, deployed in a few minutes, so that you can test the most common attacks exploited on a database by hackers with a simple internet connection.

As all these components are stored in the workshop's DBSec-Lab VM, you can conduct your attack without any risk and without fear of breaking anything to test database security use cases in an environment pre-configured by the Oracle Database Security Product Manager Team.
