# Introduction to Vector Search with Oracle AI Database 26ai

This workshop will cover what AI Vector Search is and how it works. Included will be hands on exercises to:

- Introduce similarity search
- Add the new vector datatype
- Verify ONNX embedding models
- Create vector embeddings for text and images
- Perform exact similarity searches
- Create vector indexes and run approximate similarity searches
- Combine similarity searches with normal relational queries

To wrap up the lab the user will then use the data and queries defined in the lab to see how similarity search works in a pre-built APEX application.

Estimated Lab Time: 60 minutes
