# Introduction to Data Studio

This workshop introduces creating Analytic Views in Oracle Autonomous AI Database Using the Data Studio Analysis application. This Live Lab is designed to be short and approachable.

The Analytic View that you will design is simple and easy to understand. It introduces the business model and key features. You will also use the Analysis tool to view your Analytic View and verify the design.

The Data Studio Analysis tool generates all the DDL needed to create Analytic Views. You can view the DDL in the tool. If you would like to look more closely at Analytic View DDL, consider running the Oracle Live SQL Tutorial Creating Analytic Views â€“ Getting Started tutorial.

About Analytic Views
An Analytic View is a type of view in the Oracle AI Database that allows users to perform complex queries and calculations on data stored in one or more tables. These views provide a higher level of abstraction over the underlying data, allowing users to access and analyze the data in a more meaningful way. They are typically used in business intelligence and data warehousing applications. For the application developers, analytic views can simplify SQL generation and calculation expressions.

In this workshop, you will:

- Learn how to quickly create a simple Analytic View using the Data Studio Analysis application.
- Learn about the main features of the analytic view.
- Create dimensions, hierarchies, and fact measures.
- Add calculated measures.
- View the analytic view in the Data Studio Analysis application.
