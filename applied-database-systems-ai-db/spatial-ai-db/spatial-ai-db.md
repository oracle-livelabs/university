# Intro to Spatial Database on Oracle

Oracle’s mission is to help people see data in new ways, discover insights, and unlock endless possibilities. Spatial analysis is about understanding complex interactions based on geographic relationships – answering questions based on where people, assets, and resources are located. Spatial insights enable you to provide better customer service, optimize your workforce, locate retail and distribution centers, evaluate sales and marketing campaigns, and more. With Oracle’s spatial offerings, developers, database professionals, and analysts can use a comprehensive suite of spatial data management, analytics, and visualization tools to integrate spatial analysis and mapping into applications on enterprise grade data management infrastructure – Oracle AI Database and Oracle Exadata. Innovative technologies of Oracle Cloud and Oracle Autonomous AI Database, the industry’s only self-driving, self-securing, and self-repairing database, are available to spatial applications.

As illustrated below, the spatial features of Oracle AI Database provide scalable and performant storage, processing and analysis of both basic and advanced spatial data types. A series of deployable Java EE components are also provided to support common mid-tier services.
