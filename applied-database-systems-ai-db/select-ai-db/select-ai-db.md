# Introduction to Generative AI using Select AI

In this workshop, you will learn how to use Autonomous Database Select AI (Select AI) to query your data using natural language; you don't need prior knowledge of the data structure or how that data is accessed. Next, you'll use those capabilities in a voice-enabled APEX app that enables you to get answers to your questions from your desktop or mobile device.

NOTE: This workshop requires access to a Large Language Model (LLM). You can use LLMs from OCI GenAI, OpenAI, Azure, or Google Gemini. If you want to use OCI GenAI, ensure that your tenancy is subscribed to one of the following regions (at the time the workshop was last updated): US Midwest (Chicago) (default), Germany Central (Frankfurt), UK South (London), Brazil East (Sao Paulo), or Japan Central (Osaka) regions in order to run this workshop. See the OCI documentation for more details. For the current list of regions with Generative AI, see Regions with Generative AI.

What is Natural Language Processing?
Natural language processing is the ability of a computer application to understand human language as it is spoken and written. It is a component of artificial intelligence (AI).

What is Generative AI?
Generative AI enables users to quickly generate new content based on a variety of inputs. Inputs and outputs to these models can include text, images, sounds, animation, 3D models, and other types of data.
