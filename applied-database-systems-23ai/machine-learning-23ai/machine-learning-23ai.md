# Intro to Machine Learning

In this workshop, you will test drive Oracle Machine Learning on Oracle Autonomous Database. You will explore OML Notebooks by creating notebooks, setting the service level, and scheduling a notebook job. In the Introduction to OML4SQL lab, you will use the SQL API via notebooks to implement a short data science project that forecasts product sales using a time series model. In the Introduction to OML4Py lab, you will use OML4Py to create a proxy object, explore and prepare data, build and evaluate models, and use those models to score data. In the next lab, Introduction to OML4R, you will use OML4R to create a proxy object, explore and prepare data, build and evaluate models, and use those models to score data. In the Introduction to OML AutoML UI lab, you will use the no-code user interface OML AutoML UI to run an experiment that builds and ranks models, and deploy a Naive-Bayes classifier. You will also explore a notebook generated from a model produced by the experiment. Finally, in the Introduction to Oracle Machine Learning Services lab, you will score singleton and mini-batch records with a Naive-Bayes classifier and use the Cognitive Text feature to analyze a text string.

Estimated Lab Time: 2 hours 30 minutes
